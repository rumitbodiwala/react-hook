# react-hook
Hooks are the new feature introduced in the the React 16.8  version. It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions     which"hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. It does not work inside classes.

Hooks are backward-compatible.

Hooks are similar to JavaScript functions, but you need to follow these two rules when using them. 
1. Only call Hooks at the top level.
2. Only call Hooks from React functions.
